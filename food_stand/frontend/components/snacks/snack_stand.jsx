/*
In this file we will define the presentational component to render our
SnackStand.

Again, if you get stuck, look at the fruitStand component as a reference.
*/
import React from 'react';
// 1. Import the SnackInput component!

// 2. Define a functional component called SnackStand.
//    - it should define a function that accepts props as its sole argument
//    - it should define a variable that stores an array of <li>'s that
//      each will display one snack. (HINT: use the map() function! to map over the array of //                                    snacks in our state)
//    - It should return jsx that:
//      - displays a <ul> of the snack <li>'s
//      - As well as any necessary buttons
//      - and the SnackInput component
const SnackStand = (props) => {
  //
  // your code goes here


  return(
    // your code goes here
  );
};


// 2. Remember to export your component so that it can be connected to the store
//    in the SnackStand container!
