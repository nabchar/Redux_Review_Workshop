/*
In this file we will define our snack Reducer.

Be sure to import your snack action constants and the associated actions.

Also remember that you do not want to mutate state!
Always return a brand new object as state instead.

Export your reducer at the end!

As before, refer to the fruitReducer if you get stuck.
*/

// 1. Import

// 2. Define _defaultState

// 3. Define your snackReducer, which takes your old / previousState
//    and a the action as arguments and returns the newState.
//
//
//    3.1 Use Object.freeze to prevent mutation of oldState.
//    3.2 Use a switch statement to handle each possible action.
//    3.3 Remember to return oldState by default.
